        I am a PhD student in pure mathematics and part of the <a href="(http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/)">analysis research group</a> at the University of St Andrews.
        My current research is on fractal geometry and related fields in analysis, supervised by <a href="(http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/)">Dr Jonathan Fraser</a>
        <a href="(http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/)">Professor Kenneth Falconer</a>, and funded by a scholarship from the <a href="(https://www.carnegie-trust.org/)">Carnegie Trust</a>.

        I love engaging in outreach and giving talks to both specialist and general audiences. If you'd be interested in having me speak at an event, please get in touch.
